<h1>Download MCM model input files</h1>



<p>This archive contains ASCII files of the MCM code in FACSIMILE format. </p>

<ul>
  <li>Users may experience some difficulties in trying to run these codes depending 
    on the version of FACSIMILE they are using. </li>
  <li>The models have been tailored specifically for FACSIMILE version 3.05 (23.12.1993).</li>
  <li>With the later versions of FACSIMILE for windows, some changes need to be 
    made to the code. These include specifically the command functions EXEC (now 
    EXECUTE) and PSTREAM (now SETPSTREAM).</li>
  <li>Users should contact the distributors of <a href="http://www.mcpa-software.com/">FACSIMILE (http://www.mcpa-software.com/)</a> 
     in case of major difficulty, 
    as we can not provide information on updates to the FACSIMILE program which 
    prevent it from running FACSIMILE code written for an earlier version.</li>
  <li>The output files generated at present contain diagnostics and complete variable 
    listings, and are very large. Hence, users are advised to customize these 
    models with respect to the output that they require, and also to consider 
    the overall time scale and time steps for the integrations which are currently 
    set. </li>

  <dd>Provides a FACSIMILE deck implementing the Master Chemical Mechanism v2.0 

    with a basic initialisation using typical concentrations of the photochemically-labile 

    species at the ppb or so level. These initial concentrations have no particular 

    significance and provided solely to implement the MCM v2.0 in the simplest 

    realistic way. </dd>

  <dt><b>MCM2cal.fac</b> </dt>

  <dd>Provides a FACSIMILE deck with an initialisation which represents the typical 

    conditions found in the USA. It represents the average conditions in terms 

    of initial concentrations, emissions, boundary layer depths, temperatures 

    and humidities from 40 EKMA OZIPR trajectory model experiments covering all 

    the major ozone exceeding air basins. Again the run is meant to be illustrative 

    and covers the conditions appropriate to the intense urban scale photochemical 

    ozone formation associated with the North American continent.</dd>
