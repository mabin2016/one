 <h1><b>MCM/AtChem Online Tutorial</b></h1>

 <p><i>With thanks to C. Martin and R. Sommariva</i></p>

<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>
<p> The Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) is based on the original protocol devised by Jenkin et al. in 1997, which has 
subsequently been updated and improved (Saunders et al., 2003; Jenkin et al., 2003).  The MCM can be easily 
navigated and downloaded (in a variety of formats, either in full or subsets of the mechanism) from the 
<a href="http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM-devel/" target="_blank"> MCM website</a>.</p>

<p><b><a href="https://atchem.leeds.ac.uk/">AtChem on–line</a></b> is a modelling tool designed for running simulations of the Master Chemical Mechanism using just your web browser, no installation is required. 
The user needs only to supply two files: one with the chemical reactions (extracted directly from the MCM) and one with the initial concentrations, changing the other parameters if necessary 
and press “Submit&#65533;. A link to a zip file with the results should then be available to dowload.</p>

<p>Currently there is one login for everyone &#65533; this will be changed in the future and users will need to register to receive an individual login. 
Until then, remember that everyone can access your data.</p>

<p>The following tutorial contains a variety of exercises designed to demonstrate all the features of <b>AtChem Online</b> by using
 the Master Chemical Mechanism in the context of environmental chamber studies. The tutorial consists of:</p>

<p> To complete this tutorial you will only need a web browser, a program such as word pad or notepad to view and edit 
input files and a spreadsheet package such as MS Excel for processing the model output</p>

<p>Most of the exercises are based on real data from chamber studies carried out at out various <a href="http://www.eurochamp.org/" target="_blank">EUROCHAMP2</a> facilities.  For more information please visit the <a href="http://mcm.leeds.ac.uk/MCM/">main MCM website</a>.
